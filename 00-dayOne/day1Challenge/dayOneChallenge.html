<!--NOTES. first div ID = truth/lie. Danielle did a div ID (not class) for the h1 then closed div.
for the first H3, she did a div CLASS called "option" and closed after the p. She used the class "option"
for the remaining truths/lies.
Formatting option 1: use STYLE tags, then put your CSS straight into the html doc. This is good to know,
but NOT best practice-->
