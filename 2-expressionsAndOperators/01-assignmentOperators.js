//MULTIPLICATION ASSIGNMENT) operator is *=)
r *= 1; // same as saying r = r * 1

//DIVISION ASSIGNMENT (operator is /=)
r /= 1; //same as r = r / 1

// REMAINDER (modulus) ASSIGNMENT (operator is %=). Will tell you what's left after you divide by a number. Will come in handy for fizzbuzz.
r %= 1; // r = r % 1

// EXPONENTIAL ASSIGNMENT (operator is **=)
r **= 1 // same as r = r ** 1
