// ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
// * Assignment operators change the value of the variable for the remainder of the code!

let r = 5;

// ADDITION ASSIGNMENT (operator is +=)
r += 1; //same as saying r = r +1


//SUBTRACTION ASSIGNMENT (operator is -=)
r -= 1; // same as saying r = r - 1

//MULTIPLICATION ASSIGNMENT) operator is *=)
r *= 1; // same as saying r = r * 1


//DIVISION ASSIGNMENT (operator is /=)
r /= 1; //same as r = r / 1

// REMAINDER (modulus) ASSIGNMENT (operator is %=). Will tell you what's left after you divide by a number. Will come in handy for fizzbuzz.
r %= 1; // r = r % 1

// EXPONENTIAL ASSIGNMENT (operator is **=)
r **= 1 // same as r = r ** 1
